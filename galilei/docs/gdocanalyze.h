/**
 * The GDocAnalyze class analyzes a given document by coordinating the
 * following steps:
 * -# It determines the filter corresponding to the type of the document to
 *    analyze.
 * -# It uses the current tokenizer to extract the tokens from the text
 *    provided by the filter (child classes of GFilter).
 * -# The tokens are then passed to the analyzers in the order specified in the
 *    configuration to be treated (stemming, filtering, etc.).
 *
 * In practice, it manages the tokens extracted from the documents by the filter
 * and their occurrences (position, depth and syntactic position). Once the
 * analysis steps are finished, it build a vector and a concept tree using the
 * tokens for which a concept is associated.
 *
 * It is supposed that each token of a given type in a document as an unique
 * name and corresponds to one concept only. It is the responsibility of the
 * filter to ensure it.

 * Once a document is analyzed, it send a notification 'DocAnalyzed'. It can be
 * catched by all classes inheriting from R::RObject that become an observator
 * with the command (generally in the constructor):
 * @code
 * InsertObserver(HANDLER(TheClass::Handle),"DocAnalyzed");
 *
 * @endcode
 * A method must then by created:
 * @code
 * void TheClass::Handle(const R::RNotification& notification)
 *	{
 *	   GDocAnalyze* Analyzer(GetData<GDocAnalyze*>(notification));
 *    cout<<Analyzer->GetLang()->GetCode()<<endl;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @internal
 * The class manages the list of tokens found in the current document, in the
 * container OrderTokens (where they are ordered by name) and in Tokens, as well
 * as their occurrences (Occurs).
 *
 * To avoid the allocation and deallocation of multiple chucks of memory, all
 * tokens and occurrences are stored once created (in MemoryTokens and
 * MemoryOccurs) and then reused during the next analyzes.
