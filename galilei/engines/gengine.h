/**
 * The GEngine class provides a representation for a generic search engine. An
 * engine plug-in may :
 * - Make a direct search in the actual corpus of the session.
 * - Call an external engine (for example Google Search), create a document in
 *    the session and process the results.
 * - Call a ranking algorithm to compute the rankings of the results.
 *
 * In practice, a search engine performs two steps:
 * -# It calls the PerformRequest(GSearchQuery*) method. It is a pure virtual
 *    one that must be written by inheriting classes.
 * -# If a ranking algorithm is associated to the engine, it is called after the
 *    query is treated through the GComputeRank::Rank(GEngine*) method. In
 *    practice, the ranking algorithm is supposed to modify the rankings of the
 *    fragments added as results through the 'AddResults' methods.
 *
 * Each time a engine wants to add a results, it must call the one of the
 * AddResult methods.
 *
 * It is the role of inheriting classes to ensure that the query submitted to
 * an external search engine respects its constraints. In particular, it must
 * probably formulate a new compatible query based on the one used in GALILEI.
 *
 * @warning The ranking, \f$ranking\f$, associated by a given search engine must
 * respect the constraint: \f$0\leq ranking \leq 1\f$. Otherwise, an exception
 * is generated. This constraint ensures that each engine normalises its
 * rankings. Without this normalisation, rankings from different engines cannot
 * be compared.
 *
 * See the documentation related to GPlugIn for more general information.
