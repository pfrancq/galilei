/**
* The GMatrixMeasure class provides a representation for a measure,
* \f$ [M]=m_{i,j} \f$, represented by a matrix of values, such as the similarity
* between two elements. A cutoff frequency can be specified.
*
* The class maintains the mean and the deviation of the values computed. A
* minimum value is computed using:
*
* \f$ \min([M])=\overline{[M]}+DeviationRate \cdot \sigma_{[M]} \f$
*
* The measure may be symmetric: \f$ m_{i,j}=m_{j,i} \; \forall i,j \f$
*
* The user has three choices to manage the matrix :
* -# The full matrix is maintained. It is the fastest access but it uses also
*    the most amount of memory. This is particularly useful if most values are
*    not null.
* -# A sparse matrix is maintained. It uses less memory that the full matrix,
*    but is also slower. This is particularly useful if most values are
*    null. If most values are not null, this is never a good choice.
* -# A list of nearest neighbors is maintained for each element (line). The
*    class tries to compute, for each value \f$ i \f$, a given number of
*    minimal values \f$ m_{i,\bullet} \f$. This type needs to have the matrix
*    stored in memory or in a file. In this case, The Measure function returns
*    the "on the fly" computed similarity between two objects. The Info method
*    should be used to get a pointer to all nearest neighbors of a given
*    object.
*
* The user may also specified if the matrix is maintained in memory, in a file
* or both. In this latest mode, the matrix is loaded the first time and saved
* at the end. The matrix is created in memory at the first call to it.
*
* If the full matrix is managed, changes (such as a modification of an element)
* imply only the re-computation of the corresponding line and column. In the
* other cases, the whole matrix is re-computed (also if only one element
* changed).
*
* @remarks The class supposes that the identifiers of the elements are continuous and
* that the first identifier is one.
* @author Pascal Francq.
