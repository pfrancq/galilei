 *
 * GALILEI is a research and development platform in the field of information
 * science.
 *
 * \section galilei_main_classes_sec Main classes
 * The main classes are:
 * - GGALILEIApp.
 * - GSession.
 *
 * A new application using the GALILEI platform should define a class
 * inheriting from GGALILEIApp. This class will manage the plug-ins and their
 * configurations. A global variable GALILEIApp is created.
 *
 * To work on a given "world" (a given set of documents and profiles), the
 * application should create a session through GALILEIApp.CreateSession. To
 * delete the session, GALILEIApp.DeleteSession should be called.
