/**
* The GStatement class provides a representation of a statement in the form of
* a triple of objects (concept, concepts types, documents, profiles, etc.).The
* first element represents the subject, the second element is the predicate and
* the third element represents the value.
*
* It can be used, for example, to represent a herarchical relation between two
* concepts. Suppose that the two concepts "car" and "electric car" are defined.
* It is then possible to define a third concept "IsA" and a new statement
* ("electric car","IsA","car").
*
* In the case that two concepts are linked by a symetric relation (such as a
* synonym), it is the responsible of the developer to take this into account.
* In practice, two solutions exist. First, two statements can be created where
* each concept is first a subject and then a value. Second, a coherent
* convention is adopted for naming concepts that are predicates in order to help
* the developer to determine if a given predicate is birectionnal or not. The
* first solution is simplier but consumes more memory.
*
* The statements can be seen as a directed graph with a weighted edge
* representing an object between nodes also representing objects.
*
* The GKB class maintains two lists of statements: "normal" ones that are
* stored, and "internal" ones that are just created in memory (for example
* between a GConceptList and its GConcept).
