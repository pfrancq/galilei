GALILEI PlugIn : StatData
This plug-in computes several statistics concerning data extracting from documents. It is used to evaluate which data are the most relevant for the different categories.

QUICK BUILD
-----------
1) How-to build (command-line):
- create a build directory (by exemple /path/to/galilei/build)
- cd /path/to/galilei/build
- cmake .. [OPTIONS]
- make or make VERBOSE=1

2) How-to build (Ecplise):
before the first build:
- create a build directory (by exemple /path/to/galilei/build, and for Eclipse correct work, this place is very great)
- cd /path/to/galilei/build
- cmake .. [OPTIONS]
- update Eclipse C++ project options:
	--> C/C++ Build (click on title)
		-> builder settings tab
		-> disable 'use the default build command' (untick checkbox)
		-> fill the 'build command' text field with 'make -C ${project_loc}/build VERBOSE=1'
	--> C/C++ Build (click on title)
		---> Settings
			-> enable the good parser on the 'binary parsers' tab (ELF related for Linux)
- configure a target for all in Ecplise

ABOUT OPTIONS (when running cmake)
-----------------------------------
In CMake, options are in the form -D<option_name>=<option_value>, where <option_name> (case sensitive) and <option_value> are mandatory.
When you set a value, it's stored in cache, until you provide a new value.

So if you first configure with
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debugfull
the first time, the project will be build with debug informations.  Future cmake invocation without paramater (like cmake ..)
still prepare configuration for debug.  You need to set one time the new value for the configuration to update this setting
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
And again, until you didn't say it, cmake will keep this setting.

This is false if you remove the content of your build directory (you must past again your options)...
