* The KView class provides the view widget for the document
* instance connected to it and is displayed as a MDI child window in the main
* view area of the KGALILEICenterApp class instance. The KGALILEICenterApp
* class also has an eventFilter() method that gets installed on every
* KView instance to control events of the type QEvent::Close.
* The document connected to the view instance keeps a list of all view that
* represent the document contents as there can be more than one view. Views get
* created in KGALILEICenterApp::createClient() and automatically added to the
* list of views.
* The KView class inherits QWidget as a base. Another possible
* inheritance besides specialized widgets could be QMainWindow so that you can
* easily set up the main area of your view by setting another view as main
* widget (QMainWindow::setMainWidget() ).
