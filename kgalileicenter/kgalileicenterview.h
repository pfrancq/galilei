/** The KGalileiCenterView class provides the view widget for the document instance connected to it and is displayed
 * as a MDI child window in the main view area of the KGalileiCenterApp class instance. The KGalileiCenterApp class also has an eventFilter()
 * method that gets installed on every KGalileiCenterView instance to control events of the type QEvent::Close.	
 * The document connected to the view instance keeps a list of all view that represent the document contents as there
 * can be more than one view. Views get created in KGalileiCenterApp::createClient() and automatically added to the list of views.
 * The KGalileiCenterView class inherits QWidget as a base. Another possible inheritance besides specialized widgets could be
 * QMainWindow so that you can easily set up the main area of your view by setting another view
 * as main widget (QMainWindow::setMainWidget() ).
 * NOTE: The close event always has to be empty (DON`T CALL QWidget::closeEvent(e) in closeEvent()) because the installed
 * event filter can only manage a forward implementation. If the QCloseEvent is received by the KGalileiCenterView, the overwritten
 * event handler has to do nothing as the eventFilter has set accept() or ignore() already. If QWidget::closeEvent() is called
 * again, the default event handler will accept the close event and the window gets destroyed even if the installed eventFilter
 * has set the event to be ignored.
