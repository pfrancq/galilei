I - Requirements:

To run 'upgalilei', you have to create:
- one directory 'galilei' directory in your '/var/log/'
- one directory 'galilei' directory in your '/etc/'
- one configuration file named "galilei.conf" in your '/etc/galilei/'.
      ( -> see 'Description of "galilei.conf" for details')
- one configuration file named "galilei.galileiconf" in your '/etc/galilei/'.
      ( -> see 'Description of "galilei.galileiconf" for details')

You MUST have read and write access to the directories and files your created !


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

II - Descritpion of "galilei.conf":

'galilei.conf' is a XML configuration file you need to run the 'upgalilei'
program. This enables you to provide information without using an graphical
interface.
Here is an example of a galilei.conf file:
//--------------------------
<!DOCTYPE GALILEI>
<GALILEI>
	<World Name="galilei" Host="ulb.ac.be" User="user" Pwd="pass" />
	<Log File="/path/to/logs/galilei.log"/>
	<ConfigFile="/etc/galilei/galilei.galileiconfig"/>
</GALILEI>
//--------------------------
The "World" tag  enables you to define the world you want to connect : its name,
its host, the user name and password.
The "Log" tag defines the path to the log file for the program. You MUST have
read/write access to the directory you specify here ("path/to/logs" in our
example). The log file is created automatically, you don't need to create it.
The "ConfigFile" defines the path to XML configuration file containing the
values for parameters needed by the program (-> see.'About "galilei.galileiconf"
file' for details).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

III - About "galilei.galileiconf" file:

'galilei.galileiconf' is a XML file generated by the program containing the
value of each parameters.
You can modify this file, especially if you don't want to use the graphical
interface to change the parameters.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV - About the plugins:

To run 'upgalilei', the program need to know where to search for plugins.
Firstly, the program checks the environment variable 'GALILEI_PLUGINS'. If this
variable exists, it supposes that the plugins are located there.
If 'GALILEI_PLUGINS' is not defined, the program checks the environment variable
'GALILEI'. If this variable exists, it supposes that the plugins are located in
the sub-directory 'plugins' of the one stored in 'GALILEI'.
If none of these variables are defined, the program cannot run.
